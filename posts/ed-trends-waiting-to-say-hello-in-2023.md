## 4. Distance and Hybrid Learning | Blended Learning

In addition to the comfort, the time and expenses related to better education drastically went down due to remote learning.

However, this convenience is hindering student's social life and networking. Therefore, educational institutes are now considering adopting a blended learning method, combining positive aspects and eliminating negative aspects of online and onsite learning.

## 5. Cultivating Entrepreneurial Mindset

The entrepreneurial mindset embeds constancy, tenacity, creativity, problem-solving, and cooperation within a perceiving entrepreneur. Education framework in many parts of the world is criticized for hindering the ability of risk-taking and creative thinking as entrepreneurs and leaders in the future.

According to an article on STEM Entrepreneurial Mindset published by California State University, Chico, blending Entrepreneurial Mindset and Design Thinking with undergraduate research opportunities gives them a framework to build confidence and understanding to persevere through their educational challenges and connect their learning and insights to the world around them. An entrepreneurial mindset teaches students to learn from failure.

2023 is going to be a stirring year with a lot more adventure ahead in the field of education, which is blended with more technology. Stay Tuned Falks!
