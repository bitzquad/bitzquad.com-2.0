## 4. Distance and Hybrid Learning | Blended Learning

However, this convenience is hindering student's social life and networking. Therefore, educational institutes are now considering adopting a blended learning method, combining positive aspects and eliminating negative aspects of online and onsite learning.

## 5. Cultivating Entrepreneurial Mindset

The entrepreneurial mindset embeds constancy, tenacity, creativity, problem-solving, and cooperation within a perceiving entrepreneur. Education framework in many parts of the world is criticized for hindering the ability of risk-taking and creative thinking as entrepreneurs and leaders in the future.

According to an article on STEM Entrepreneurial Mindset published by California State University, Chico, blending Entrepreneurial Mindset and Design Thinking with undergraduate research opportunities gives them a framework to build confidence and understanding to persevere through their educational challenges and connect their learning and insights to the world around them. An entrepreneurial mindset teaches students to learn from failure.
